## üßæ Project Summary

This repository hosts the **Vulnerability Index Dashboard**, a replicable, flexible platform designed to assess regional vulnerability using multidimensional indicators. The tool supports decision-making for aid organizations, governments, and researchers seeking to prioritize interventions based on both population needs and contextual vulnerabilities.

**Key features:**
- üìç **Geospatial precision** at sub-national levels
- üß† **Multi-criteria decision-making** via customized weighting
- üìä **Interactive visualizations** for exploration
- üîÅ **Easily replicable** for any country with relevant data

Originally built as a **case study for Colombia**, this dashboard can be adapted for any geography.

## üìê Methodology: Step-by-Step Breakdown

The dashboard follows a clear, modular pipeline:

### 1. Data Acquisition
You must supply:
- üìÑ An **Excel file** with `Data` and `Metadata` sheets.
- üóÇÔ∏è A **shapefile (.zip)** representing sub-national boundaries.

### 2. Preprocessing
Performed automatically by the app:
- Drop variables with >70% missing data
- Standardize region codes to merge with the shapefile
- Impute missing values using **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**
- Adjust indicator direction by inverting variables where **higher values = lower vulnerability**

### 3. Normalization (User-Selectable)

| Method             | Description                                | Best Use Case             |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Z-score**        | `(x - Œº) / œÉ`                              | Normal distributions      |
| **Percentile**     | Relative ranking                           | Outlier-resistant         |
| **Min-Max**        | `(x - min) / (max - min)`                    | Preserves spacing         |
| **Quintile**       | Bins into 5 groups                         | Simpler interpretability  |
| **Equal Interval** | Divides range into equal slices            | Uniform data              |

The final output is rescaled to a [0‚Äì10] scale across all variables.

### 4. Dimensional Weighting
Thematic dimensions (e.g., Health, Education, Environment) are defined via the `Metadata` sheet. Each dimension receives a user-adjustable weight.

**Formula:**

- Dimension Score (Mean of Normalized Indicators):

$$
\text{Dimension Score} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n} \text{Normalized Indicator}_j
$$

- Vulnerability Index (Weighted Sum of Dimension Scores):

$$
\text{Vulnerability Index} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left(\text{Weight}_i \times \text{Dimension Score}_i\right)
$$


## Install Dependencies

Open R or RStudio and run:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "sf", "plotly"))
```

## Run the Application

Launch the dashboard using RStudio:

```r
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

## Usage

- **Upload Data Files:**
  - Click on the ‚ÄúUpload Data File (Excel)‚Äù button and select your prepared Excel file.
  - Upload the corresponding shapefile (.zip) using the designated button.

- **Select Merge Variables:**
  - Choose the merge field from both the Data Sheet and the shapefile to combine the datasets.

- **Choose Population Variable:**
  - Specify the variable representing the total population for size adjustment calculations.

- **Configure Transformation Method:**
  - Select from available options (Percentile, Min-Max, Z-score, Quintile, Equal Interval) based on your data distribution.

- **Adjust Dimension Weights:**
  - Use the slider controls to set the importance of each dimension (e.g., Health, Education) to tailor the index to your analysis needs.

- **View Visualizations:**
  - Navigate through tabs to explore interactive maps, data tables, and Pareto analysis outputs.

- **Download Data:**
  - Export processed data, transformed data, and calculated index scores for further analysis or reporting.

## Configuration & Customization

- **Adapting to Different Geographies:**
  - Update the Excel data file and metadata to match the local context (e.g., new indicators, different merge variables).
  - Redefine variables requiring inversion or size adjustments based on regional priorities.

- **Customization of Visualizations:**
  - Modify color scales, map layers, and popup contents within the code to suit your audience or presentation style.

- **Modular Code Structure:**
  - The repository is organized into separate modules for data preprocessing, transformation, index calculation, and visualization. This structure allows for easy extension and modification.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Merge Variable Issues:**
  - Verify that the merge variable is formatted consistently between the Excel file and the shapefile (e.g., use leading zeros if necessary).

- **Data Format Errors:**
  - Ensure that all numerical indicators are properly formatted as numeric in the Excel file and that missing data handling thresholds are set appropriately.

- **Shapefile CRS:**
  - If the uploaded shapefile lacks a defined Coordinate Reference System (CRS), assign one using a GIS tool before uploading.

- **Weight Adjustments:**
  - Experiment with different weight settings to observe how changes impact the overall Vulnerability Index. Save different configurations for comparative analysis.
